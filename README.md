The history of life unfolds within a phylogenetic context. Comparative phylogenetic methods are statistical approaches for analyzing historical patterns along phylogenetic trees. This task view describes R packages that implement a variety of different comparative phylogenetic methods. This is an active research area and much of the information is subject to change. One thing to note is that many important packages are not on CRAN: either they were formerly on CRAN and were later archived (for example, if they failed to incorporate necessary changes as R is updated) or they are developed elsewhere and have not been put on CRAN yet. Such packages may be found on github, R-forge, or authors' websites.

*Getting trees into R* : Trees in R are usually stored in the S3 phylo class (implemented in [ape](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ape/index.html)), though the S4 phylo4 class (implemented in [phylobase](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/phylobase/index.html)) is also available. [ape](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ape/index.html) can read trees from external files in newick format (sometimes popularly known as phylip format) or NEXUS format. It can also read trees input by hand as a newick string (i.e., "(human,(chimp,bonobo));"). [phylobase](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/phylobase/index.html) and its lighter weight sibling [rncl](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rncl/index.html) can use the [Nexus Class Library](http://ncl.sourceforge.net/) to read NEXUS, Newick, and other tree formats. [treebase](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/treebase/index.html) can search for and load trees from the online tree repository TreeBASE, [rdryad](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rdryad/index.html) can pull data from the online data repository Dryad. [RNeXML](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RNeXML/index.html) can read, write, and process metadata for the [NeXML](http://www.nexml.org) format. PHYLOCH can load trees from BEAST, MrBayes, and other phylogenetics programs (PHYLOCH is only available from the author's [website](http://www.christophheibl.de/Rpackages.html)).

*Utility functions:* These packages include functions for manipulating trees or associated data. [ape](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ape/index.html) has functions for randomly resolving polytomies, creating branch lengths, getting information about tree size or other properties, pulling in data from GenBank, and many more. [phylobase](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/phylobase/index.html) has functions for traversing a tree (i.e., getting all descendants from a particular node specified by just two of its descendants). [geiger](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/geiger/index.html) can prune trees and data to an overlapping set of taxa. [evobiR](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/evobiR/index.html) can do fuzzy matching of names (to allow some differences).

Root ancestral character states under Brownian motion or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models can be reconstructed in [ouch](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ouch/index.html), though ancestral states at the internal nodes are not. Discrete characters can be reconstructed using a variety of Markovian models that parameterize the transition rates among states using [ape](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ape/index.html). [markophylo](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/markophylo/index.html) can fit a broad set of discrete character types with models that can incorporate constrained substitution rates, rate partitioning across sites, branch-specific rates, sampling bias, and non-stationary root probabilities.
